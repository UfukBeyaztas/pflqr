The files; \
dgp1.R \
dgp2.R \
auxilary_functions_fpca.R \
auxilary_functions_FPLS_FPCA.R \
auxilary_functions_fpqr.R \
auxilary_functions_pfqr.R \
include the auxilary functions used in the estimation and prediction steps of the methods considered in the paper. \
The file run_order.R is used to load all of the above auxilary functions. \
The file script_for_Monte_Carlo_experiments.R presents example runs performed under both DGP-I and DGP-II. \
The file script_for_Mary_River_flow.R is used to obtain the results in the Empirical data analysis section of the paper.
